<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Well hello! Being a web developer is no piece of cake okay, so you gotta appreciate what I've made. 
  I'm a second year computer science engineering student from Bangalore barely making it through life. 
  As of today, my wrist is aching(probably from all the writing I did yesterday) and I'm halfway through closing 
  all this and watching season 3 of Rick and Morty.
</p>

<p>I've been pondering what I want to do with my engineering degree. Okay that's all BS I already know what I want. 
  I just want to be in a peaceful place (prefereably Switzerland or Netherlands) and get a cybersecurity job 
  there and buy a house that's secluded from civilization. Most people don't know why they chose engineering 
  at least I know one thing about myself for sure.

<p>Oh you're still here? I might've just earned myself a stalker lol. Anyways here some Lorem Ipsum 
  to read you creep. Donec euismod vestibulum arcu, a blandit metus mattis ultrices. Integer quis hendrerit justo. Maecenas sed tempor mi.
  Fusce egestas urna leo. Mauris viverra sem sed libero egestas, volutpat aliquet magna porta. Quisque id diam sed ipsum
  interdum sollicitudin id quis augue. Donec congue nisl nec massa ornare imperdiet quis quis odio. Etiam ut volutpat
  nisl. Vestibulum hendrerit justo nibh, eget consequat magna fermentum finibus. Pellentesque et urna fringilla, rutrum
  neque in, varius leo. Vestibulum efficitur id massa eget pellentesque.</p>
